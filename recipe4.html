<h1>How to make Vegetarian Pasta</h1>
<p>
    <pre>                                  Heat oil in a large pot over medium. Add garlic and onion - cook slowly for 3 to 4 minutes until onion is translucent and sweet.
Turn heat up to medium high, add zucchini and capsicum. Cook 1 1/2 minutes.<br>
Add remaining ingredients EXCEPT pasta and broccoli. Stir until tomato paste dissolves.
When liquid starts bubbling, lower heat to medium, add pasta and stir. Top with broccoli, push in.
Place lid on and cook for 5 minutes.
Remove lid. Cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently, until pasta is almost cooked through and most of the liquid has been absorbed by the pasta.
Stir through half the cheese (if using). Adjust salt and pepper to taste.
Top with remaining cheese, put lid on. Leave for 1 minute until cheese is melted and pasta is perfectly cooked.
Garnish with parsley and serve immediately. Don't leave leftovers in the pot, residual heat will overcook the pasta so transfer into a serving dish.</pre>
<h2>Recipe Notes:</h2>
* These vegetables can be switched with vegetables of choice - use 7 to 8 cups in total, chopped or sliced. Cook cauliflower and broccolini in the same way the broccoli is </cooked in this recipe ie placed on top of the pasta so it steams first before stirring through.<br>
1. Pasta - any short pasta can be used: penne, ziti, macaroni, spirals.<br>
Pasta cook times may need adjustment. If undercooked to your taste and liquid has reduced down, just add a touch of water. Most important is to ensure you don't overcook the pasta! Mushy pasta is not pleasant!<br>
2. Nutrition per serving, assuming 5 servings excluding the cheese which is optional. Cheese adds 120 calories per serve. If cheese is omitted, serve with parmesan instead.<br>
