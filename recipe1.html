	<h1>How To Make Avocado Salad</h1>
<h5>This vegan avocado salad is easy and quick</h5>
<p>
	      If you're using my vegan goat cheese recipe, you can throw that together beforehand. Or I like to press the tofu while I chop all my veggies.<br>
	Since I used grape / cherry tomatoes, I just sliced them in rounds. If you’re using regular sized tomatoes, I would squeeze out a little of the liquid, because it can make the salad a little soggy.<br>
	Mix the dressing in a jar by shaking it up, or in a bowl / measuring cup with a whisk (this tiny whisk is just so cute (and useful!)</p>
<p>Finally, mix the dressing with the rest of your veggies. Toss well to combine.

Serve it between a few large bowls as a meal or serve it as a side to anything from portobello mushroom steaks to a tomato soup.</p>
<h1>How Do You Keep Avocados Fresh in a Salad?</h1>
<p>The massive amount of lime juice and the pinch of salt in this recipe act as a natural preservative and will keep the avocados fresh for several hours.
Unfortunately avocado browns quickly due to oxidation, so eat this salad quickly! If you’re worried it will be too much to finish, you can easily halve the recipe and make a smaller portion.

The salad is so easy to make you could just make it again the next day!</p>
